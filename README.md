### A powerful and customizable preview for the Unity inspector.

<p>Tired of Unity's tiny, unhelpful default inspector for scripts? <strong>CodePreview</strong> transforms it into a genuine productivity tool. Quickly understand, navigate, and manage your text-based assets without ever leaving the editor.</p>

#### ✨ Key Functionality
- **Theme-Aware Syntax Highlighting:** Read `C#`, `JSON`, `XML` and more with beautiful highlighting that automatically adapts to Unity's Light and Dark themes.
- **Pleasant Markdown Reading:** Instead of a plain text file, your `.md` files are presented with syntax coloring for headers, lists, and code blocks, making them far easier to read.
- **Instant Navigation:** Instantly search through any file with highlighted results and jump directly to any line number.
- **File Statistics:** Get instant insights at a glance: line and word counts, file size, and the last modification date.
- **Quick Actions Toolbar:** Edit in your IDE, copy the file path, or copy the entire content to your clipboard with a single click.

#### 🎯 Supported Formats
- `C#` (.cs)
- `JSON` (.json)
- `XML` (.xml)
- `YAML` (.yaml)
- `Markdown` (.md)
